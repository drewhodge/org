      Consolidate into a single task info about building and linking to a PDF in a
      ditamap.

      See links in attached file.

      From email thread between Sam and Mersedeh:

      **Mersedeh**: I first looked here:
      https://sites.google.com/a/salesforce.com/documentation-group/Home/checklist-for-checking-in-files/writing-tip-sheets


      Then I thought it would be somewhere here:
      https://confluence.internal.salesforce.com/display/DOCTEAM/How+to+Add+a+Ditamap+to+a+Build+Definition+File

      But it would never have occurred to me to look where you sent me to. Like, I'd
      just expect a lone topic "create a PDF of a ditamap" that tells you all the
      steps A to Z: from adding a ditamap to the build definition to adding the link
      to the topic.

      **Sam**: This page details how to link to a PDF that's generated from a build
      definition: https://confluence.internal.salesforce.com/display/DOCSTYLE/xref

      <xref format="pdf" href="salesforce_assets_cheatsheet.pdf"
      otherprops="on_server" scope="external" type="new-window:PDF">Getting Started
      with Assets</xref>

      Your build definition decides what the PDF file name will be. Unless you use the
      param that renames it, the ditamap name becomes the PDF name.
